# Simple-Linear-Regression-Analysis-of-Big-Mac-Prices-on-GDP-per-Capita


In this project I conducted a simple linear regression of Big Mac Prices on GDP Per Capita. 
I downloaded data on GDP Per Capita and Big Mac prices from every country in the world from 2011 to 2021. 
Included in the code is an analysis on my findings. I used Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and sklearn imported into Python. 

I ended up finding that there is a positive correlation in Big Mac prices and GDP per Capita. 

However, this can be victim to underfitting, which means that the model is too simplistic and cannot capture all the dependencies among the data. 
This typically means all dependencies will be described by GDP per capita and may not be representative of other variables that also have an effect on Big Mac prices. 
Regardless, this is a good exercise to practice simple linear regression and shows an obvious relation between the dependent and independent variable.
